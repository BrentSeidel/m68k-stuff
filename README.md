# Assembly Language Stuff for the M68000 CPU

Now that I have a [68000 simulator](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Sim-CPU)
running, I needed some software for it.  So, I decided to try writing a
simple multitasking operating system that can run a few tasks.  The first
goal is to have something that will blink the lights on the [Pi Mainframe](https://github.com/BrentSeidel/Sim-CPU)
in interesting patterns.  The second goal is to learn a bit about how
to write an operating system kernel and provide services.  The third
goal is maybe to have something uself.
